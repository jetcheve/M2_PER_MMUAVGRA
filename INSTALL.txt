Development of Mobility Models for UAV Group Reconnaissance Applications
(RandomWalk, RandomWaypoint & Pheromone) on JBotSim.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS :

You just have to create a new Project under the eclipse IDE, and then, 
replace the "src/" folder by our, 
and add the other folder "/lib" and "/image".

In order to use the library JBotsim, you have to right click on your project, 
choose properties (or on your keyboard, press "Alt+Enter"), 
then choose "Java Build Path", go on the "Libraries" tab and finally 
click on "Add Jars ..." and go to search the jar file "jbotsim.jar" in the 
"/lib" folder.

Finally, to see the pictures of the UAVs, you have to add the folder "/image" to 
the "Java Build Path" too. So like before, right click on your project, 
choose properties (or press "Alt+Enter"), then "Java Build Path", 
go on the "Source" tab and to finish, click on "Add Folder ..." 
and check the folder.

Now you can run any models.

Enjoy !
