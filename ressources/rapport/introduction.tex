\chapter*{Introduction}

As part of our Master's degree in Computer science at the New University of Bordeaux particularly in the Study and Research Project, we had to study a research article in groups of 5 people. Every group had to choose a subject of research among those proposed. Our group chose a topic related to the drones. The title of this article is \textit{Mobility Models for UAV Group Reconnaissance Applications} written in collaboration by \textit{Erik Kuiper} and \textit{Simin Nadjm-Tehrani} published in 2006. The clients who suggested us studying this article are Messrs Serge Chaumette and Vincent Autefage. Our teaching assistant is mister Pascal Desbarats.\\

\noindent During this project, for a period of 3 months, we had to do many points :
\begin{itemize}
\item study of research article,
\item reading it in English,
\item study existing models,
\item extract and implement algorithms of models present in the article,
\item compare the model in order to recover same results,
\item compare our model with models of other groups.
\end{itemize}
%The aim of this matter is to make us study a research article, to extract an %algorithm from it and to implement it.
%We must therefore study a model that meets the aerodynamic properties of drones.\\

Many mobility models exist and are often based on the real world.
The article specifically discusses two mobility models that are Random Mobility Model and distributed Pheromone Model.\\

We tried to give the best possible image of our project through this report. It represents each stage, from the study of the existing to the implementation of an algorithm. It also shows our organization we established and carried out.
