\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

\item The area coverage\\
We need to cover the area the most efficiently and rapidly.

\item The connectivity\\
UAVs need to be always in contact with the C\&C to transmit the information at any time.



\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

\item No excessive use of bandwidth\\
The bandwidth is a limited and a precious resource. Therefore UAVs have to used bandwidth the better possible to not overloaded her.

\item Regurlarly updated the information\\
UAVs transmit their information to the C\&C and other UAVs when they are near . Thus, if a UAV have data much old, it is possible that he scans a part of the area already scanned. Hence, the data transmitted by UAVs have not to be older than prescribed and if each UAV has up-to-date information, the scan coverage will be more quickly.

\item A robust model\\
Lost or unaivable UAVs during a scenario not involved the good progress of the scan coverage. The resulting of a lost UAV should not degrade the final result.

\end{itemize}
