Thanks to many councils of our teaching assistant mister Pascal DESBARATS and our instructors misters Philippe NARBEL and Adrien BOUSSICAULT, we were able to realize a serious and steady work. They indicated us methods to make a success of this project and explained to us for what we expected from us. We thank them for the help throughout the project.\\

The help of our clients, misters Serge CHAUMETTE and Vincent AUTEFAGE, was also very precious us. The proposed article was really very interesting. The study of this one concerned teachings seen during this half-year. We thank them for having provided an interesting article.\\\\

We also wish to thank mister Arnaud CASTEIGTS, who has us a lot to help for the understanding of the JBotsim library, and on the difficulties which we met concerning the implementation on JBotsim.\\\\

To finish, we thank the professors of English misters Jean-Christophe COQUIHAT and Jean-Jacques BERNAULTE. They allowed us to correct this report and to improve it in linguistic term.
