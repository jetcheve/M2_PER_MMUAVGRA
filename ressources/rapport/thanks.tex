\chapter*{Thanks}

Thanks for the many councils of our teaching assistant mister Pascal DESBARATS and our instructors misters Philippe NARBEL and Adrien BOUSSICAULT, we were able to realize a serious and steady work. They indicated us methods to make a success of this project and explained us what they expected from us. We thank them for the help provided throughout the project.\\

The help of our clients, misters Serge CHAUMETTE and Vincent AUTEFAGE, was also very precious for us. The proposed article was really very interesting. The main subject of this study concerns a matter seen during this half-year. We thank them to have provided an interesting article.\\

We also wish to thank mister Arnaud CASTEIGTS, who provided us a lot of help for the understanding of the JBotsim library, and on the difficulties which we met concerning the implementation on JBotsim.\\

To finish, we thank the English professors, misters Jean-Christophe COQUIHAT and Jean-Jacques BERNAULTE. They helped us to correct this report and to improve it in linguistic term.
