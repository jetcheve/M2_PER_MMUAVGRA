\chapter{Scenarios}
We saw that the issue of this article is "how well scan an area?".\\ So the scenario is the reconnaissance of an area. It takes place in a square with a side length of 30 kilometers.\\ For this scenario, we use 10 UAVs and a command and control center (C\&C). \\Each UAV starts at the middle of the south edge heading north near the C\&C.
The UAVs have to scan entirely the map once per hour. \\For the reconnaissance data to be of any use it needs to be transmitter to the users that need it. In this scenario, it's the C\&C. So each UAV need a communication path to C\&C to transmit the data collected. They have to maintain a contact with the C\&C, so they need to be close enough a neighbour UAV.
