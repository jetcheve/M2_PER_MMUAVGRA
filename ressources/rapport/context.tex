\chapter{Context}

A drone is an unmanned aircraft remote-controlled or autonomous. It is equipped with different sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, camera, etc..) And they allow it to move in its environment.\\

Today, UAVs are increasingly present on French territory and around the world. There are different types of drones with different missions. For example, some drones are monitoring (building, historical monuments ...), others are designed to collect information, others have military uses or transport.Two types of UAVs are currently present: the drones said civilian and military drones. In the military context, UAVs can be used to penetrate areas that may be too dangerous for humans. They may include mapping areas for the tracking area.\\

Much research has been dedicated to these devices for many years, including on cooperation and communication between them several drones. These fleets of drone used to perform tasks as efficiently as possible. We need to know how they will move together, collision avoidance, avoid them to do twice the same work etc ... These constraints can be resolved through mobility models based on communication.\\
Many research topics are dedicated to these types of mobility within fleets drones. They study the different ways of drones' moving in their environment all together.\\

The purpose of this article is to scan an area previously defined as soon as possible and if possible once per hour. The problem of this article is:
\textbf{How well scan an area? As much as Quickly as possible in a limited time and at least, once every hour}.
