\chapter{Context}

A drone is an unmanned aircraft remote-controlled or autonomous. It is equipped with different sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, camera, etc..). And they allow it to move in its environment.\\

Today, UAVs are increasingly present on the French territory and around the world. There are different types of drones with different missions. For example, some drones are monitoring (building, historical monuments ...), others are designed to collect information, others have military uses or transport. Two types of UAVs are currently present: the so-called civilian drones and military drones. In the military context, UAVs can be used to penetrate areas that may be too dangerous for humans. They may include mapping areas for the tracking area.\\

Much research has been dedicated to these devices for many years, including several drones cooperating and communicating together. These fleets of drone were used to perform tasks as efficiently as possible. We need to know how they move together, deal with collision avoidance, avoid to do twice the same work etc ... These constraints can be resolved through mobility models based on communication.\\
Many research topics are dedicated to these types of mobility within fleets drones. They study the different ways of drones' moving in their environment all together.\\

The purpose of this article, is to \textbf{scan an area previously defined as much as possible, in a limited time, at least, once every hour and if possible as quickly as possible}
