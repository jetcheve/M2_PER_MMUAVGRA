\chapter{Limitations}

The main article \cite{UAV} makes the comparison of two mobility models, a random mobility model and a pheromone mobility model. But it's not adapted to make this comparison because only the pheromone mobility model is adapted to scan an area.
An other limitation is not to consider the utilisation of the bandwidth, lost of data package, and the realistic distance of communication between UAV (8km in the article).
In the real world, UAV can't suddenly change of direction (more than 45 degree for example), but in the experiments, we don't consider that.
