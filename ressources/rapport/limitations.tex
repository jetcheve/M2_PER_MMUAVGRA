\chapter{Limitations}

The main article \cite{UAV} makes the comparison of two mobility models, a random mobility model and a pheromone mobility model. But it's not adapted to make this comparison because only the pheromone mobility model is adapted to scan an area.\\

First, we don't considered the use of the bandwidth whereas in the real life. Indeed, we can't use an illimited bandwitdh with no collision and lost data package.
Moreover, the realistic distance of communication between UAV (8km in the article) is nowadays not possible. \\

In addition, coverage and connectivity of communication between UAV are two conflicting objectives. Indeed, we can't cover a huge area with no relay between UAVs in order to maintain a best connectivity. And in the mobility models, the UAVs are distributed over the map.\\

To finish, in the real world, UAV can't suddenly change of direction (more than 45 degree for example), they can't also fly at the same position and same altitude but in the experiments, we don't considered that.
