\part{Assessment}

During this project of studies and researches, we studied an article which is called \textit{Mobility Models for UAV Group Reconnaissance Applications}. After reading it, we have identified the main issue of the article. Then, we did a study of existing models described in the article, here the mobility models. This article describes two principal models : a model based on random movements of UAV and a model based on the use of pheromones.\\
We implemented both models mentioned above, more another model (random Waypoint) that our clients have asked us. We compared these three models to scan an area.
