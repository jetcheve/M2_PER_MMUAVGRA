\section{Mobility models}

We can imagine a few improvements about the pheromone model like following :

\begin{itemize}

\item In this article, they use The pheromone repel model wich had a bad connectivity. To improve the connectivity, we can add attractive pheromone. At regulary time, the C\&C can add attractive pheromone in its place to force the UAVs to move to it in order to have a regulary update of the full map that the C\&C gets.

\item An other way to improve this model is to add more C\&C on the area. Therefore each UAV has a map more often update.

\item We can also split the map in equivalent part considering the number of drones. We give a different piece of an area to each UAV. To do that we can add attractive pheromone in these area. So each UAV scans their area and goes to the C\&C to transmit his map.

\item We can increase highly the connectivity adding others small UAV wich could maintain the communication with the C\&C. These small UAV can make the communication path between an UAV and the C\&C. Be aware of placing the small drones above the standard drones to avoid collisions.

\end{itemize}
