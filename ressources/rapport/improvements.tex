\begin{itemize}

\item In this article, they use The pheromone repel model wich had a bad connectivity. To improve the connectivity, we can add attractive pheromone. At regulary time, the C\&C can add attractive pheromone in its place to force the UAVs to move to it. So we have a regulary update of the full map.

\item An other way to improve this model is to add more C\&C on the area. Therefore each UAV has a map more often update.

\item We can also give a area to each UAV. To do that we can add attractive pheromone in different area for each UAV. So each UAV scan their area and move to the C\&C.

\item We can increase highly the connectivity adding others small UAV wich could maintain the communication with the C\&C. These small UAV can make the communication path between an UAV and the C\&C.
