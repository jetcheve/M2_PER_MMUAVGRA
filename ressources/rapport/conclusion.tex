\part{Conclusion}

This article shows that we can't have a good coverage with an adequate communication connectivity. We must find the balance between this two points to have the best model. The random model is simple but it has low connectivity with a bad coverage of area. The best model presented on the article is the pheromone model. It has a good scanning properties thanks to its pheromone repel. Indeed, over the time, this model can reach the 100\% of coverage, contrary to the others, which will finally stay steady. But like the random model, it has a low connectivity. A good connectivity is essential to collect data in a more efficient way.\\

We have seen that the pheromone model isn't perfect and however it has ideal characteristic that are not possible in real condition. Like the communication's range of each UAV is impossible in real life. They can't have a range of 8 km with illimited bandwidth. They have no lost packets,  no contention, no overloads. With all these constraints, the connectivity of the pheromone model will be lower than those in article.\\
Both models can't be used to real scenario of reconnaissance.
