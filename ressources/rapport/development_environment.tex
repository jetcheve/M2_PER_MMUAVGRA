\chapter{Development Environment and Conventions}
In this part, we will see the development environment we used, and the programming conventions we've applied.

\section{Development Environment}

\section{Programming Conventions}
First, we've choosed to used the Java Coding Conventions, which we can see in the following link - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf\\

Then, in order to create our documentation, we've used the Doxygen Convention, viewable here - \url{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html}\\
We've relied heavily on this documentation and have mostly employed these protocoles below.\\

\lstset{language=Java,basicstyle=\footnotesize,commentstyle=\color{blue}}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=trBL, title=Doxygen Convention for classes]
/**
* @class name of the class
* @brief Description of herself
*/
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=Java,basicstyle=\footnotesize,commentstyle=\color{blue}}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=trBL, title=Doxygen Convention for methods]
/**
* @brief Description of the method
* @param the parameters and their descriptions
* @return the description of what return the method (optional)
*/
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=Java,basicstyle=\footnotesize,keywordstyle=\color{red},commentstyle=\color{blue}}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=trBL, title=Doxygen Convention for members]
int var; /**< Detailed description after the member */
\end{lstlisting}
~\\
We've also resorted to programming conventions that we defined between us.\\
For example, when a part of a code, was not finished yet, we put the following lines above the concerning part.\\

\lstset{language=Java,basicstyle=\footnotesize,commentstyle=\color{blue}}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=trBL, title=Programming convention for unfinished code]
/**
* @TO_DO
* Description
*/
\end{lstlisting}
~\\
We've also used a convention for the bugs found and wrote these protocoles, depending on whether the bug was resolved or not.\\
We used it, in line with the Bug Tracking of GitHub.\\

\lstset{language=Java,basicstyle=\footnotesize,commentstyle=\color{blue}}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=trBL, title=Programming convention for bugs]
/**
* @BUG
* @Unfinished/finished
* Description
*/
\end{lstlisting}
~\\
To finish, we've created the five essential files for a project : \\
\begin{itemize}
\item INSTALL.txt  : Installation instructions for the project,
\item LICENCE.txt  : Licence and copyright \copyright{} of the project,
\item README.txt   : General description of the project,
\item AUTHORS.txt  : Authors of the project,
\item MANIFEST.txt : Tree structure and files list of the project.
\end{itemize}
