Development of Mobility Models for UAV Group Reconnaissance Applications
(RandomWalk, RandomWaypoint & Pheromone) on JBotSim.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT :

Our project consists in many points :
- study a research article on mobility models
- search and study more existing mobility models
- extract algorithms of the main artcile
- implement them (it's the mobility models quoted previously)
- commpare results with the article and between them
- interpret these results
